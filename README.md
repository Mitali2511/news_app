# News app


In this project I have build news app, with 2 pages- listing and news details.
On homescreen there is
-search bar where user can search news 
-a tabbar to view news by category.
-list content is from Api.

on News detail screen there is heading, content and image , and two buttons
-Read Story : by clicking on read story user can open news url in browser for that  I have used url launcher package,
-share now : by clicking on share now users can share news link to their contacts ,for sharing  I have used share_plus package. 

Other than that I have used-
-http to get api response,
-Getx for state management,
-MVC
